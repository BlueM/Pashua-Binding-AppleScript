Overview
===========

This is an AppleSript language binding (glue code) for using [Pashua](http://www.bluem.net/jump/pashua) with AppleScript. Pashua is a Mac OS X application for using native GUI dialog windows in various programming languages.

The repository currently contains the compiled AppleScript that was distributed with Pashua 0.9.5.1. Compiled code obviously makes no sense in a source code repository, therefore it will be replaced with actual source code in the near future.

Requirements
=============
This code will run on any Mac OS X version that is supported by Pashua.
